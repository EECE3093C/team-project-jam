# TEAM JAM: Party Queue
## HIGH LEVEL
Our product is an application built off spotify's API that allows you to modifiy the spotify queue to have a
better experince when group queueing. The current spotify group listen queue just plays song in queue order no matter
who queues. Our product will adjust the queue so no matter the order of songs being queued, every one's songs will get played.

## WHOM IS IT FOR?
Our product is for anyone who likes to use Spotify with friends but doesn't want to manage
the queue to make sure everyone songs are played.

## WHAT PROBLEM DOES IT SOLVE?
It solves the problem of one person queuing 100 songs before anyone else and forcing everyone to
sit through all of those songs before anyone elses music can be played. Our system will make it so 
everyone's songs are played equally no matter when they are queued.

## COMPETION
The only solution currently on the market is to use the basic Spotify queuing resource / their group listen feature and manaually 
adjust the queue.

## WHY?
When you are hanging out with you friends trying to manage the queue with large groups
becomes more and more difficult to ensure that everyone's music plays. Our system will make it
so you spend less time worrying about the songs and more time enjoying it.


## SOFTWARE
The code will use spotify API to interact with spotify, JavaSciprt/HTMl/CSS through angular 
for the front end, the back end will use C++ and our data will be stored in SQL database.

## Challenge
Removing and manually adjusting the queue might present issues, the main way to get around this
will probably be that the queue will be shown on our front end not on spotify's, so the adjustment
can be done through that.
